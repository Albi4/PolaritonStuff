# PolaritonStuff

Some codes developed during the master thesis and now imporved for the manuscript on superradiant instabilities.
I'm trying to convert the main codes I have to be in Phyton or Julia, but here also the main c and c++ file will be added.

The main physics is the integration of a driven dissipative system minimally coupled to a synthetic gauge field to be studied in the steady state. GPe is for a 2D system (the natural configuration for an exciton polariton system). the Diagonalization is 1D as the relevant physics happen only in a single direction.
